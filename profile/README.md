We are building **Guilda**, the next-generation bot for **Discord**. Our journey began in **January 2025**, and since then, we’ve been on a roll:  
- **873 commits** made  
- **142 issues** opened  
- **212 pull requests** submitted  
- Contributions from **5 countries** 🌍  

Guilda is **not just a bot**, it’s a way to **reimagine how communities connect**. Whether it’s advanced moderation, engaging user experiences, or seamless integrations, we’re here to revolutionize Discord servers.

### 🌐 A thriving community

The open source community fuels 🔥 our innovation at Guilda. Here’s what we’ve been up to:  
- Supporting **29 open source projects** through contributions  
- Engaging with over **50 developers** in our ecosystem  
- Hosting **bi-weekly hackathons** to bring fresh ideas to life 💡  

Are you part of the open source movement? If not, **we’ll help you get started**! Open source is powered by developers like you. [Learn how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/). 

### 🛠️ What makes Guilda special?

We’re not just building a bot; we’re building an **ecosystem**. Our key projects include:  
- [Guilda Core](https://github.com/GuildaJS/core) - The backbone of Guilda’s modular system  
- [Guilda Moderation](https://github.com/GuildaJS/moderation) - Smart tools for community management  
- [Guilda Insights](https://github.com/GuildaJS/insights) - Analytics to understand your server
